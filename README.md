# Overview
This piece of software will allow a user to play Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock.

I wrote this software to demonstrate my skill in Java. I wanted to learn how to implement variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes and arrayLists. 
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

* Have the results be written to a file and the results of three games determine a grand champion.
* Add more character options to expand the game.
